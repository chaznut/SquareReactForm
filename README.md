Example repo on how to use Square payment forms in our React UI.

In this example we use a set up that comes straight from a Square developer. This instance is set up to take credit card payments, Google Pay, and Apple Pay(this button will not show because the website/application must be registered with Apple first but all the logic is here). Below are links to the resources I used to understand how to create this form.
